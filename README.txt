Description: To allow the user to put together the perfect taco night! The user will be greeted by a clean taco prep video and a sliding menu bar for the following components of the perfect taco night:
1.    Margaritas – which should come first to get the night off on the right foot!
2.    Mexican Rice – everyone knows sides are the best part to any meal!
3.    Filling – Lets face it this is the “meat” of the whole taco.
4.    Salsa – who doesn’t need a little spice in their life!?
5.    Guacamole – because “avocado” + “anything” = LIFE!
Each page generates three recipes for the specified component, giving the user options to choose from.

APIs: Edamam (Recipe Search) and Pinterest (additional ideas to enhance the taco night)

Motivation: To create a one stop shop for the perfect taco night. The site allows the user to get all of the necessary recipes and decoration ideas in one place.
